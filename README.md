FindAllPricesProgram:
The Java program FindAllPrices runs as following:
1.	Input: The Catalog section of http://shopicruit.myshopify.com/collections/all website.
This can be sorted by any type
2.	It will traverse all the pages, while it is looking for all the items of type clock and watch, and it will add the price of all of them.
3.	Output: total number of items found, and total price of the items
Variations:
•	The input can be change to any sorted type, and will still produce the same result
•	The item’s targeted to find can be also modified on line 15 and 16, to another type that we could be interested in looking for
